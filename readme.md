# Predicting parkinson's dieases in early stage with voice recording

This work shows how to Predicting whether a person has parkinson's disease from voice recording samples collected.

The following features are extracted from the audio files:

MDVP:Fo(Hz) - Average vocal fundamental frequency

MDVP:Fhi(Hz) - Maximum vocal fundamental frequency

MDVP:Flo(Hz) - Minimum vocal fundamental frequency

MDVP:Jitter(%),MDVP:Jitter(Abs),MDVP:RAP,MDVP:PPQ,Jitter:DDP - Several 

measures of variation in fundamental frequency

MDVP:Shimmer,MDVP:Shimmer(dB),Shimmer:APQ3,Shimmer:APQ5,MDVP:APQ,Shimmer:DDA - Several measures of variation in amplitude

NHR,HNR - Two measures of ratio of noise to tonal components in the voice

status - Health status of the subject (one) - Parkinson's, (zero) - healthy

RPDE,D2 - Two nonlinear dynamical complexity measures

DFA - Signal fractal scaling exponent

spread1,spread2,PPE - Three nonlinear measures of fundamental frequency variation 

and used to build a classifier model.

The model is optimized using recall score so as to minimize false negatives. i.e. not miss out on so many people with PD

Data gotten from [UCL ML Parkinson's dataset] (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/parkinsons/)
